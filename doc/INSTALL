 Modular Remapping Model Installation
======================================

Software Requirements
---------------------

The model and analysis code consist of the Python package ``grid_remap`` and its
subpackages (``core``, ``analysis``, and ``tools``). You need to have a basic
Python environment set up for scientific computing, including numpy, scipy,
traits, matplotlib, and PIL for image output. Ideally, you should run the code
interactively at an IPython command prompt.

The easiest way to set up a complete Python environment is to install the
Enthought Python Distribution (EPD). The model code was developed and tested on
EPD v6.2. The latest version of the EPD can be found here:

    * Standard: http://www.enthought.com/products/getepd.php
    * Academic: http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php

It is available for all major operating systems. The ``grid_remap`` software
should also run on all major platforms, but any platform-specific bugs or errors
can be emailed to me at `jmonaco@jhu.edu <mailto:jmonaco@jhu.edu>`_.

If you don't want to install the entire EPD, the most critical libraries needed
can be downloaded and installed from their respective websites:

    * Python: http://www.python.org/getit/
    * NumPy/Scipy: http://www.scipy.org/Download
    * Matplotlib: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
    * IPython: http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/
    * PIL: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
    * ETS/Traits: http://code.enthought.com/source/
    
This can be done, but it really is a pain. The EPD is a big download, but it Just
Works(TM).


Software Installation
---------------------

Download the zip-file archive from ModelDB. Then you need to extract the archive
and run the *setup.py* file from a terminal::

    $ tar xzf grid_remap.tar.gz
    $ cd grid_remap/
    $ sudo python setup.py install

This will ask for your administrator password and install the ``grid_remap``
package at the standard location on your computer for third-party python
libraries.

Now, you can test to make sure everything is working properly by importing the
package in IPython::

    $ ipython -pylab
    In [0]: from grid_remap import *

Starting IPython in the ``-pylab`` mode will enable a Matlab(R)-like environment
with figure, plotting, and basic analysis commands available. The first time you
do this import, the software will ask you to set up a directory where analysis
output will be saved. It can be any directory that you will have full access to.
When the import is finished, you can run the ``whos`` command in IPython to see
the simulation and analysis classes that have been loaded (most of the classes
needed are loaded by default).
